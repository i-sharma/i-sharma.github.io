# Duties of an early stage founder

I'll keep this short.

As of my understanding today, my supreme goal is to get crystal clarity on:

1. The Ideal Customer Profile - who am I building for (who's buying my product)?
2. The Product - what am I building and why (what problem would it solve)?
3. The Business Model - A strategy to bring in revenue and to grow it.

Other questions matter too like the competitive moat, or how big this can get if it works. But those are secondary to the three above.

It's all bayesian - I have a prior, and I conduct experiments and then update my hypothesis. Repeat.

If clarity is what I am after, then I must maximize the speed to insight. There's no reason why something that could be done today should be done tomorrow, given it's aligned to my goals.

I might be wrong, but I can not afford to have my vision blurred.
