How to test prompts and tool descriptions?
  We put a lot of effort into the descriptions and specs for these tools across a wide variety of agentic tasks. We tested them to uncover any ways that the model might misunderstand the spec, or the possible pitfalls of using the tools, then edited the descriptions to preempt these problems. We believe that much more attention should go into designing tool interfaces for models, in the same way that a large amount of attention goes into designing tool interfaces for humans.
