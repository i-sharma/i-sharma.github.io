let's address this issue:
https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/6219
fetch the issue, understand it, then walk me through your plan to fix it.

with claude code, gemini, cline, augment code and openhands

+ build your own agent bench 

then take things from deepagents and manus to test them out


Fucking awesome - like that building browser blog that's been getting attention
